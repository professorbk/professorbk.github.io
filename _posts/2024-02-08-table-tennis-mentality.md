# The Dark Side of Competitive Mentality in Table Tennis

## Disclaimer:

- This article contains some dark/brutal knowledge/experiences, that are ONLY meant to be used in the context of competitive Sports in general, and Table Tennis in particular. I do not encourage anyone to use them outside that context.
- Competitive" in this context refers to the Psychology/Mentality aspects of competitive Table Tennis, and not the physical aspect of it. You don't need to be a member of a Table Tennis club or play in a league to be "competitive". Whenever you play, no matter against whom, you can decide to be "competitive" or not.
- I am not an expert in Table Tennis, I am not a member of a club, and I play Table Tennis as a hobby. This is based on my own subjective experiences, which can be wrong. Use it at your own risk. Constructive criticism is always welcomed.

## Table tennis reflexes human nature/characters

Human beings, to adapt to the people around them and their surrounding environment, sometimes have to suppress their own emotions/behaviors, consciously or unconsciously.
These emotions/behaviors are not always visible, but they are always there. It's fair to say that we all wear different kinds of masks in different situations, to some extent.
Under pressure, these masks start to crack, and even shatter, gradually revealing one's hidden faces, nature and characters. That is why Table Tennis, as a Sport of constant stress, is a great way to unveil the character of a person.

I have witnessed cool, calm, collected, confident men turned into spoiled, broken, insecure crybabies in just a split of a few seconds. It's spectacular xD (I saw a part of me in that picture too).
I have been playing competitive Sports most of my life, starting with Football (at least 5 years), then Basketball (more than 10 years) and currently Table Tennis (totally 5 years).
Football and Basketball bring the good and bad out of me, but Table tennis, it brings the best and worst out of me.

Challenge against/See through myself and others, both mentally and physically, is the part I really like about Table Tennis. I also thrive on winning, because I'm very competitive.

## The Psychology/Mentality aspects of competitive Table tennis

Over 10 years ago, I read an article about a journalist who went around the world interviewing/studying the top athletes in different sports, and he found out that they all have one thing in common: they are all extremely competitive. This is their common secret to win: "If you want to win, you have to put yourself above your opponents". I didnt think about it much at that time (I didn't even read the whole article).

I resumed playing Table Tennis three years ago, and this time I wanted to level up the game; winning was all I thought of. Thus, I recalled that article, and I asked myself: "Putting yourself above a weaker opponent is easy. Against someone at the same level, can do. But what about stronger opponents? How can you win against someone who is better/has more experiences than you?"

I came up with a strategy, tested it, and it worked out for me (not all the time): objectifying the opponents. When I am in a competitive game, I will ignore the existence of my opponent. I will focus on his hand and body movements (facial expression sometimes, but not much). "What do I need to do to win this game? You are not the almighty player; you are a rock, a tool, and I will step over/on you, then come out as the winner. I look toward your position, but I do not look at you. I don't play against you; I play against myself. I am the biggest opponent I need to beat, and I'm not scared of myself". This process of thinking eliminates the human factor of my opponent; it helps me totally focus on my game; it removes anxiety, nervousness, and self-doubt.

In a competitive game, I also don't (try not to) show my emotions. I make myself as calm/static as the surface of a lake or a mirror. I can imagine some opponents looking at me; it is not me that they see; they see themselves. Then all the anxiety, insecurity, self-distrust, anger, etc. are reflected back to them. I turn the 1 vs 1 game into the 2 vs 1 game. They beat themselves.

Once again, I must remind that if you want to use these tactics, then do it in the context of competitive Sports only. If you ever felt uncomfortable playing against me, don't take it personally. I'm just too competitive, sometimes :)

## The rewards of being competitive in Table Tennis

Being competitive motivates/reminds me to keep getting better, and the game is more fun that way. There are games in which I feel like I am in total control, on both sides of the table. I know what I can/cannot do, what my opponent can/cannot do, what they are thinking, how their mood is, and what I need to do to win. There are so many things in life I cannot control, but in Table Tennis, I know I can (not all the time). It is a very empowering feeling; it makes me feel confident. I do gain a lot of confidence, and I don't keep it just at Table Tennis, instead, I use it in other aspects of life too. I feel more confident/comfortable just talking to other people about anything. It's like a snowball effect; once I know how/invest enough time to get it to move, it keeps rolling and it's getting bigger.

  
  

## The DOs and DON'Ts in competitive Table tennis

### DOs

- Do read some books/articles about psychology in Sports. Everyone will get better at the physical trainings, sooner or later. However, only a few has the mindset/mentality of a winner/fierce competitor.

- Do trasktalk with your friends while playing. It's fun, it adds some hot sauce to the game, and it makes the game more competitive. The game tastes much better that way.

- Do spend a lot of time on the fundamental moves instead of the "fancy" ones. The fancy moves are rarely used in the game; the fundamentals decide the game. The difference between a pro and an amateur is that the pro does the fundamental moves much more and much better. From my experience/observation (I'm not a pro), in the long run, the ones who do the fundamentals right from the start can maximize their potential and go very far, while the ones who do/invent "their own moves" instead of the fundamentals will just stuck midway and will not progress much. Why are the movements of the pros "kind of similar" to each other? Because there were countless people who experimented with various moves, for a long time; then they came up with the thing called "fundamentals". Don't reinvent the wheels.

- Do play casual if you don't like being competitive or playing competitive is too much for you. There is nothing wrong with that. You will gradually get better, it just takes longer time.

  

### DON'Ts

- Don't trashtalk with strangers or people you don't know well. It only leads to troubles.

- Don't use cheap/dirty tricks. I have witnessed a few players who did this just to win (just a few, mostly club players; the more competitive, the higher the stake, the more toxic it can be). I despise these actions. The strong/dignified/confident never do that; only the weak/petty/cowardly do. Nobody wants to play with/hangout with people who play dirty. Table Tennis is not only about winning; it's about building one's character and connection with other people too. Don't tarnish Table Tennis!

  

## Conclusion

Competitive Table Tennis is fun, challenging, rewarding, and at the same time can be brutal, toxic, and demoralized. However, at the end of the day, no matter if I win or lose, I always shake the hand of my opponents and I smile (to them and to myself too; not all the time though, especially when I lose). Having fun, getting better, while making some good friends/frenemies. That is my way with this Sport.

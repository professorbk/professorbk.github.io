Short bits on Germans and Germany

They can be real or just pure fatasies

Don't take them seriously

I met a G on the street. He told me: "In Germany, if you just meet someone, and you want to make friend, just greet them "Was geht ab Digga". It works like a charm. Trust me, bro".

I trusted him, and it didn't work.

He got me, I had to think hard for a way to give it back, triple.

Whenever I greet my colleagues, I say "Hallo" with a smile (not the "polite smile", but the "affiliative smile").

Initially, not many people smiled back, but that did not bother me. I like doing it with people I feel comfortable with, and it is a habit for me already.

I have trouble looking people in the eyes

But for sure it is easy for me to smile.

After 3 months, I saw some more smiles at my office, not all the people and not all the time, but surely there were more.

Work suddenly became much lighter.

Did they smile because they felt like smiling or because I started it, so they "had to" finish it, though?

A German bro, out of nowhere, told me "You are a 30-something man, who dresses like a 20s and talks like a 17".

Should I feel good about it? No, but I could, and I would.

Should I feel bad about it? No, it's just a statement or an observation.

Doesn't matter, because he is my Digga.

I heard that German were very punctual, and they liked talking about plans, making plans and sticking to those plans.

Most of my friends are on the opposite. They heavily lean toward the "spontan" spectrum of the plans.

It's brave for being that "unorthodox".

I know about this too late. If I knew it beforehand, I would still befriend them.

We are basically (and naturally) like a crew already, it's hard to get out now.

I asked around some German friends: "Which party did you vote for in the recent Federal elections?".

They gave me ambiguous statements.

We ended up talking about something else.

"Why are you beating around the bush? I have no idea what you do, but I never expect it's to be a Politician. Are you sure you are German? You can comfortably tell me about your mental health or the nasty things you did, but not your political viewpoint."

I have an idea why, but still this doesn't make sense to me.

I guess I don't understand fundamental things like Democracy, or Freedom of Speech yet.

I talked to a German girl at a bar.

That was the first time we met, but there was something about her face that kept me wondering: "She looks very familiar. Have I met her elsewhere before?"

The conversation started 20 minutes already, but I could not focus on what she was saying because I kept thinking about that question.

And when the answer came to my mind, I told her, unconsciously: "Ahhhh, i got it. You have a face that is very German".

She looked surprised and confused.

Every time I submit my passport photo to the Auslanderbehörder, I need to check if my photo is eligible by comparing it with a "sample photo", which shows the face of a woman (in her 30s or 40s I guess). To me, her face is "very German" and I find it pretty.
I subtly complimented her for having a pretty face, then we never talked again.

Es ist mir unfassbar.

By the way, I only drank apple juice that night. What can possibly go wrong?

I asked a German friend: "It's Sunday, what are you gonna do this afternoon?"

"Check on my bicycle for tomorrow"

"Why?"

"Because I want it to work and not pay for repairs."

It seems to me, that she thinks a little too far towards the future.

I check if my bicycle works the moment I put my butts on the saddles, and I do not think about the maintenance cost at all. I care if my bicycle can take me from point A to point B (hopefully in one piece), when I need to use it.
Anyway, I still think the people here are overpaying for bicycles.

"How can they spend 500€ , 1000€, or even more on a bicycle? It is just a bicycle, 200€ is the maximum I am willing to spend for it."

"If your bicycle is cheap, then you don't have to worry much about it, do you?"
